The team that built Chicago Space Odyssey is comprised of five aspiring developers at Dev BootCamp Chicago: Jaime Schubert, Amelia Padua, Michael Main, Javad Afshar, and Ryan Verhey.

### The Project
==================
CSO is a way for people to explore known exoplanets while visiting popular locations around the city of Chicago. The project uses a lightyears to miles scale to plot exoplanets at accurate scale distances with the Adler Planetarium representing our solar system. Use our mobile and web ([CSO Web](https://github.com/michaelanthonymain/tosche-station-web "CSO Web")) apps to plan your adventure, learn about exoplanets, and view and contribute to digital geocaches. Explore our galaxy while you explore our city.

### Acknowledgements
==================
This project would not have been possible without the support of Zooniverse, the Adler Planetarium, and the guidance of Stuart Lynn. Thank you for everything.
